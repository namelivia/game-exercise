This is just an expermient, or a programming exercise, to see if I can make a simple multiplayer game separating server, client, and graphical representation.

## How to run it

Open one terminal and execute `./run_server` to leave the server listening for connections.
Now open another terminal and execute `./run_client` to start a client.
